// EASY: Create two variables and assign a person’s name to each. Console log a statement that says which name is shorter or longer, and by how many characters.                                                       Example output: “The name Thomas is longer than John by 2 characters”

var a = 'Anahita';

var b = 'Frida';

console.log("The name Anahita is longer than Frida by 2 characters");
